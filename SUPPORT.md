## Before Asking for Help

1. **Search existing issues** - Your question may already be answered
2. **Check the documentation** - README, docs folder, wiki
3. **Try to reproduce** - Can you isolate the problem?
4. **Gather information** - Version numbers, error messages, environment details

## Providing Good Information

When asking for help, include:

- What you're trying to do
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Relevant code snippets or error messages
- Your environment (OS, language version, etc.)
